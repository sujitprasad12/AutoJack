# AutoJack
AutoJack is used to auto detect your browser plugins and extensions.

This plugin will be browser independent and should be made more fesable to all the kinds of browsers mostly used.

The main focus of the development of this plugin is to give an example for new developers and to help the opensource community to use the browsers features without wasting more time in R & D and start using the codes to reach their goals faster.

Developer documentation will be provided once the release of version 0.5 beta.

Currently looking foreward for the technology to work on this.

We need help through out the world to build this application. This is not an one person task.
